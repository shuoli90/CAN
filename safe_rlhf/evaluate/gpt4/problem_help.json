Aim with your dominant hand and keep your non-dominant hand behind the slingshot for stability.\n3. Aim carefully: When aiming, make sure to take your time and line up the shot properly. Use both eyes to aim and be sure to adjust your aim based on the distance and angle of the target.\n4. Adjust the rubber bands: Make sure the rubber bands are adjusted properly for your slingshot. If they are too tight or too loose, they can affect the accuracy of your shots.\n5. Use the right ammo: Choose the right ammo for your slingshot such as marbles or steel balls.
